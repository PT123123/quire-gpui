# `--workspace` survived the two-crate week and is now decoration: this workspace
# has one member again, and `quire-core` is a *dependency*, which no cargo flag
# run from here will test. Its 431 tests belong to that repository
# (`cargo test --all-targets` there). So a green `just check` here means the shell
# compiles against the pinned rev and its own suite passes — never quote it as
# "the whole app is green".
#
# The third line keeps `--release` and is *not* to be weakened: measured
# 2026-10-05 at `72a69f9`, replacing it with a release-opt-in dev-profile build
# (`--profile dev` + `lto`/`codegen-units`/`strip` via `--config`) rebuilt **325
# crates** — switching a profile invalidates every unit in the graph, the same
# 7m59s trap PERFORMANCE.md records for `codegen-units`, and it would have made
# every `just check` slower rather than faster. `--profile` is also mutually
# exclusive with `--release`, so there is no flag that asks for "release checks,
# cheap". The line stays exactly as it was. `docs/BUILD_PERFORMANCE.md` §2 has
# the numbers (a `.rs` touch is 209 s: 11 s link, ~198 s one crate's codegen at
# `codegen-units = 1`) and §4-R1 why that is a structural cost rather than a
# misconfiguration.

# The separate `--target-dir` is the point of this recipe (ADR-0134). `software`
# is a *different feature set* from the default `femtovg`, so cargo sees the two
# builds as unrelated units: sharing one target directory meant it kept every
# unit it had ever produced for this crate, and because the app's rlib is ~1 GB
# with debug info, alternating between `just run` and `just shot` accumulated 26
# copies of the same library — 63 GB of the shell's 71. `target-shot` is its own
# directory, so a shot no longer invalidates the app build and the two do not
# compete for the same space; `just clean` removes it.

# deploy a release into the workshop's archive: one folder per release,
# C:\workshop\quire-desktop-<version>\quire-desktop-<version>.exe, so the file
# carries the version the folder is named after. The name is `quire-desktop`, the
# shell: the workshop lists one folder per release of several applications, and a
# bare `quire-<version>` would not say which of the two shells put it there. The
# script bumps [package] version's patch, builds, and commits and
# pushes the bump; the archive folder is new every release, so nothing is ever
# overwritten and no running instance is ever in the way (ADR-0139). The bump
# has to precede the build because build.rs stamps the exe's version block from
# that same key.
#
# The build is ~2m30s, and that is one crate's codegen rather than a cold cache:
# the bump invalidates the whole `quire` crate, and `[profile.release]`'s
# `codegen-units = 1` + thin LTO is *both* the audited size choice and the
# fastest setting for this repeat build (measured 2026-09-25 — PERFORMANCE.md
# "Build cost", and ADR-0024's update).
deploy-workshop:

# publish a release: bump the patch, build the release exe, and attach two files
# to a GitHub release — Quire-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe (install\
# build-installer.ps1's Inno Setup program, per-user and no elevation) and
# Quire-<version>-windows-x64.zip (the same single exe `just dist` packages, for
# someone who would rather not install anything).
#
# This is the shell's *delivery*; `deploy-workshop` above is the other door a
# release leaves by, and it advances the version too. Neither replaces the other:
# a release that only went to the workshop is a folder on this machine, and one
# that was only published is a file in a browser's downloads folder.
#
# The three steps that matter are ordered the way the Android shells' publish
# orders them: the bump precedes the build (build.rs stamps the exe's version
# resource, and quire.iss reads AppVersion out of it), the assets are built
# before the push so an Inno Setup that is not installed fails before anything
# leaves the machine, and the bump lands as its own commit before the tag that
# names it. The version comes from Cargo.toml, so nothing here is bumped by hand.

# script output (`target/debug/build`, 6.7 GB, of which 15 near-identical
# 250 MB `build_script_build` copies were the bulk). The compiled artifacts stay,
