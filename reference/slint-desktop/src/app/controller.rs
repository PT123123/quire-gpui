/// an id is a per-device row number, so counting differences by id would report
/// every single row as changed on every device). A row present on one side and
/// absent on the other counts as moved — that is a note the other device has and
/// this one does not, which is exactly what a round is for — and so does a row
/// present on both whose `rev` differs, which is the revision the merge itself
/// settles on.
///
/// Rows whose uuid is blank fall back to their position in the snapshot: a note
/// written before the column existed is not a row to skip counting, and two
/// devices holding the same library list the same rows in the same order
/// (`row_count`'s own order is the export's), so position is the next best key
/// after the uuid and is the only one left.
///
/// The two functions are **key** and **content**, and neither is `PartialEq` on
/// the row. That is the whole point: `SNote`'s `id` is a *per-device* row number,
/// so deriving `PartialEq` over it says all three notes changed on every device
/// that renumbered them — which is every device. `content` therefore skips `id`
/// and keeps the row's revision, which is the field the merge itself settles on
