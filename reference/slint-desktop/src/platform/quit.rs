// The instance channel (ADR-0105, ADR-0136): how a launching process finds out
// whether a Quire is already running, which one, and — when the answer says it
// should — asks that one to end its session from outside.
//
// Why it exists. Closing the window only hides to the tray (ADR-0096), so the
// one graceful exit the app has is the tray menu's 「退出」 — and a deploy that
// wants to replace the exe cannot click a menu. Before this, replacing a
// running build meant killing it, which skips the final flush and writes no
// clean-exit record, so the next start reported a crash that never happened
// (ADR-0018 reads the missing record exactly that way).
//
// The mechanism is a byte-mode named pipe, and it is deliberately the smallest
// one that works:
//
//   * The server is created with FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE, which is the
//     whole ownership rule — the first process to name the pipe gets it, and a
//     second one fails to create it instead of silently becoming another
//     instance of the same name. No mutex, no PID file.
//   * The client is std only. A named pipe is openable as a file, so
//     `OpenOptions::open(r"\\.\pipe\quire-desktop-quit")` *is* CreateFileW.
//   * Two hand-declared `extern "system"` functions and no `windows` crate —
//     the same rule `platform::mod` states for the clipboard. kernel32 is
//     already linked.
//
// The protocol is one line each way, and the request names the ask:
//
//   * `version\n`  → the server answers `version <v>\n`. This is what a second
//     launch asks first: whether it is about to be a second session at all, and
//     which build it would be a second session of (ADR-0136).
//   * `quit\n`     → the server answers `ok\n` after it has *scheduled* the quit,
//     `err\n` if the schedule failed.
//
// The answer is the point — it lets a caller tell "an instance accepted, it is
// going to exit" from "nothing was listening", and a caller that gets no answer
// must not assume the app is going away.
//
// `quire.exe --quit` is the client half and runs before any session starts: no
// log line, no database, no window, no event loop.
